This bot is a `free auto publisher`. It publishes every message sent to an `announcement` channel.
<br>This is great if bots send messages to an announcement channel but don't update it. Or if you are just too lazy to press the `publish` button everytime you want to publish something.

(standard) Prefix: ap!
<br>Commands:
<br>`add*`: Add an announcement channel where I can auto-publish messages. (use `all` to enable every announcement server)
<br>`remove*`: Remove an announcement channel where I can auto-publish messages. (use `all` to disable every announcement server)
<br>`view`: View the added announcement channels of this server.
<br>`ping`: Get this bot's ping.
<br>`prefix`: See this server's prefix or change it.
<br>`help`: Get help command (that's this one).
<br>`about`: Get more info about this bot.

*admin commands
<br>If you don't know how to use a command, just type it without parameters and you'll get some help.
Make sure to give the bot the `MANAGE_MESSAGES` and the `SEND_MESSAGES` permission in order to publish messages.

Once the bot joins, the bot won't auto-publish until someone adds announcement channels.

Check the code in GitHub, ask any questions in the support server.
