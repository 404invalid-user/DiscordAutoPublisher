# DiscordAutoPublisher

This bot is a `free auto publisher`. It publishes every message sent to an `announcement` channel.
This is great if you don't want to use Mee6 Premium to publish feeds. So you would only need to put Mee6's feed to a text channel, change it to announcement and let the bot do the rest!
